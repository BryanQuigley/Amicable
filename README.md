This source code implements the leading-edge algorithm for running an exhaustive search for amicable pairs.

Performance when running on Core i7-4770K:

- Amicable pairs with 9-digit smaller member (10^8...10^9): 0.185 seconds
- Amicable pairs with 11-digit smaller member (10^10...10^11): 17.96 seconds
- Amicable pairs with 13-digit smaller member (10^12...10^13): 32 minutes 24.2 seconds
